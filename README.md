# ABCi: A benchmark causal inference data set

This repository provides the ABCi data set, data generation code, and code for illustrating the use of the data, as described in the draft paper (See ABCi_data_paper_draft.pdf for the draft):

### "A benchmark causal inference (ABCi) data set: simulated data on time-varying treatments, confounders and outcomes based on patients with type 2 diabetes." Ruth Keogh, Nan van Geloven, Daniala Weir.

# The data
The ABCi data set is provided as an R data file, ABCi_data.RData. 
The code for generating the data is in ABCi_data_generate.R. 
Descriptive information about the data can be generated using data_descriptives.R.

# Illustration
An illustration of the use of the data, as described in the draft paper for Example Quesion 1 (Table 2). 
The files for implementing the analyses are called from the file master_Q1.R. 
Similar code for Example Questions 2,3,4 will appear soon.
